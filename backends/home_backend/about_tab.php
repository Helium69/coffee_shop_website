<h1 class="title"> About this website</h1>
<pre>
This website is my first proper project based on my current knowledge of PHP. 
It uses basic CRUD functionality to handle user sign-up and login, including input 
validation and protection against script injection and SQL injection using input 
filtering and prepared statements. I also applied basic CSS for styling and built a
coffee shop system where users can register accounts, add funds, and make purchases 
either through balance deduction or by adding debt.

Users logged into a session can leave comments and view comments from others. The 
admin has access to all user data and transaction records, including income total. 
Admins can delete or ban user accounts and also have the ability to add new coffee 
items or add-ons.

Due to a busy academic schedule, especially with my upcoming finals, the code might 
be somewhat disorganized, and variable naming may lack consistency. I made an effort 
to organize the file structure properly, though I acknowledge that some syntax choices 
might not be optimal or follow best practices. Still, the website functions as intended. 
Unfortunately, I havenâ€™t had the time to perform thorough quality assurance, so this 
version will likely be the final update for now.
